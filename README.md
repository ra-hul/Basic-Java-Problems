# Basic Java Problems
This repository contains solutions to 12 basic Java programming problems, providing a foundational understanding of essential Java concepts such as loops, arrays, and conditionals.Each problem is solved with detailed code
and try to implement the programming logic.

## Given Problems: 
- Here is the 10 students CGPA [3.50, 3.52, 3.43, 3.63, 3.48, 3.32, 3.30, 3.60, 3.86, 3.75]. Find out who achieved the 2nd highest score. (without sorting, use linear searching algorithm)
- Sort the above scores from according to the order of highest CGPA (don’t use Arrays.sort() method, do it programmatically)
- Take a CGPA as user input. Now from the given array find if your input CGPA is present using binary search algorithm
- Generate random 10 integer numbers in an array and print out all the numbers from the array and also print the max and min number from the array.
- Write a program that will break down the amount and count notes for any given amount. Here is the notes in the given array:notes=[1000,500,200,100,50,20,10,5,2,1]
Input: 546
Output:
500 1
20 2
5 1
1 1
- Write a program that will give following output:    
12345    
1234    
123  
12  
1
12   
123 
1234
12345
- Take input as height of 10 babies in cm. Now find out the 2 lowest height of babies. (Don’t use Arrays.sort() method)
- Count number of words, number of characters without spaces, number of vowels and consonant from the given string:
Input: I am a SQA Engineer
Output: 
Words: 5
Chars: 15
Vowel: 8
Consonant: 7

- Find the number of occurrences of characters in a String
String: I live in Dhaka
Output:
i 3
l 1
v 1
e 1
d 1
h 1
a 2
k 1

- Print the  numbers which are not duplicate from the given array.
numbers=[1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 7]
Output: 
3, 6, 7

- Write a program that will take integer numbers as user input continuously and print the sum of numbers until user input q from the keyboard. When user input q, the program will be quit. If the user inputs another character, then the program will ask to input the number again.
- A core i 7 laptop price is 85000 tk and a gaming mouse price is 2500 tk. If I buy the laptop and 1 piece mouse, what will be my total cost after giving 15% discount? [Extract the digits from the paragraph and calculate the price]
